Hello! Kainuma!

I'm the head of 62nd Seiko Festa Initialization Department(unofficial), Akimasa_L.

You seem to create some repositories about the projects of 62nd Seiko Festa. But I hate it that every project is under a person "mpses". You had better think about creating a new **Organization**.

I will show you how to create a new organization.

1. Click your icon and go to settings.

1. You can find Organization tab.

1. Make a organization like this:

Thank you for reading, and have a nice GitHub life!
